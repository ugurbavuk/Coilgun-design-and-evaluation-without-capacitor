Coilgun design and evaluation without capacitor


Abstract. Capacitors with high voltage and capacity values are used in most induction coilguns that are designed and constructed. 
The fact that capacitors are quite bulky and slow in energy transfer and how a coilgun can be made without using capacitors is the 
study subject of this article. Two and four coil gun samples were made to find the essential components of an electric gun, and the 
results are reported in this article. The accuracy of the results is also confirmed by FEMM analysis for these models. The harmony of 
experimental and theoretical results shows that smaller and low cost portable electrical weapons can be a powerful alternative to 
firearms in the future.
Keywords: electromagnetic launcher, coilgun, FEMM analysis, pyFEMM simulation, mosfet power transistors.
